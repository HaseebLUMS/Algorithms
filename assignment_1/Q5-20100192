Q 5;




Say the given form of tables is form-A. 
And new form is form-B.

for Intern Preference Matrix:

say position of Ei in form-A = Ei_old
then for form-B, at each index i store the Ei_old of Ei. This way for query whether Ea is prefered over Eb, just go to 
indices a and b and gets the value Ea_old and Eb-old. So, if Ea_old is lower than Eb-old then Ea is preferred over Eb.
This makes the complexity of answering the query O(1).


for Employer Preference Matrix:


say position of Ii in form-A = Ii_old
then for form-B, at each index i store the Ii_old of Ii. This way for query whether Ia is prefered over Ib, just go to 
indices a and b and gets the value Ia_old and Ib-old. So, if Ia_old is lower than Ib-old then Ia is preferred over Ib.
This makes the complexity of answering the query O(1).

Space required:
No additional space will be required. New structure can be implemented in the same space used by old structure which is 
basically O(n*m) while n representing the interns and m representing the employers for table one and n = employers and 
m = interns for second table.
